A project i took on just to experiment with encryption and hashes. You need all files in repo for this to function minus the pw files. 


UPDATE 11/6/2025
This project has evolved to incorporate TOTP two factor alongside a more robust functionality that allows for a greater number of applications. As of the date of this entry all files beginning with the dfunc. header are no longer supported or considered within the development of Lutz Secure.
